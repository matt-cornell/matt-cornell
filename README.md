# Matthew Cornell

Hi, I'm Matthew! I generally work with Rust, but I'm also good at C++ and have experience with multiple other languages.
My main project that I'm working on is [factor](https://github.com/matt-cornell/factor), a WIP game, but I've also worked on [a cheminformatics library](https://github.com/matt-cornell/lute) and two programming languages: [Cobalt](https://github.com/cobalt-language/cobalt-lang) and [Frolic](https://github.com/matt-cornell/frolic).
