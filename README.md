# Matthew Cornell

Hi, I'm Matthew! I generally work with Rust, but I'm also good at C++ and have experience with multiple other languages.
My most mature project right now is [Cobalt](https://github.com/cobalt-language/cobalt-lang), though I've also been spending a lot of time on [my unnamed cheminformatics tool](https://github.com/matt-cornell/chem-sim).
